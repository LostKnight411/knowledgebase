description: How to create your gear list for backpacking
---

Creating a gear list is an essential step in planning for a trip.
A good gear list allows you to organize your thoughts, understand your pack weight, and get feedback from others.

:::note[Get a scale!]
To make a useful gear list, you will need a kitchen scale to weigh your gear. Manufacturer-listed weights or guesses are often very innacurate!

## Lighterpack

The best tool for creating your backpacking gear list is [Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com). You can use it to create a gear list, add categories and items, and specify a weight and price for each item.
You can also mark worn and consumable items. It creates a chart and table to summarize the weight of your setup. You also get a shareable link that you can use for collaboration or getting feedback.

A lighterpack list is embedded below for example:

import Lighterpack from '@components/content/Lighterpack.astro';

<Lighterpack slug="sl6c8y" />
