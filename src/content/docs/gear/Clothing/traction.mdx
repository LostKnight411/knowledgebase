title: Winter Traction
---

One of the key differences between three season and winter hiking is the traction requirements. "Traction" in this context is anything that helps you keep from slipping on snowy and/or icy terrain.

These can vary greatly depending on where you're hiking and the conditions at the time of your hike, however it's good to be aware of the full array of options that might be required. It's highly recommended to check with a local resource for the traction requirements of where you'll be hiking if you are traveling somewhere new.

## Microspikes

Sometimes called 'trail crampons' depending on the brand, microspikes are the bare minimum that you should expect to need if hiking in terrain that is likely to be covered in snow and/or ice.

**What Are Microspikes?**

Microspikes are spiked chains attached to rubber that fit around your boots/shoes. They should not be confused with similar things such as "exospikes" or "yaktrax" that are either chains without spikes, or metal studs attached to rubber. These other types of traction can be helpful on icy pavement or very hard packed trails, but are not good for general hiking.

**When Do You Want Microspikes?**

You should plan to have microspikes any time the trail is likely to have large sections of ice-covered ground and/or hard packed or shallow snow cover. They are especially important when doing any kind of ascending or descending.

## Snowshoes

Snowshoes are important when dealing with deeper snow that may not be packed down, and whether or not they're required will depend on your region and the conditions of the day. The less traveled a trail is the more likely you are to need snowshoes and conditions at the trailhead won't usually reflect conditions at higher elevations.

When deciding whether or not to bring snowshoes on a hike, you should consider:
- Did fresh snow fall overnight?
- Will temperatures be above freezing?
    - Warm temperatures can cause packed snow to soften.
- How popular is the trail I'm hiking?
    - Heavy snowshoe and boot traffic from others will pack down the trail, but this will typically only be the case on very popular trails at least 1-2 days after the last snowfall.

A lot of knowing when to use snowshoes comes with experience and it sometimes can be difficult to judge ahead of time if you'll need them.

### Why you want snowshoes
- Sinking down into snow with every step is tiring and slow. Having snowshoes allows you to move much more quickly and easily in snowy conditions.
- Even if the trail is already packed, snowshoes let you step off the trail. In popular areas it's common for the trail to already be packed, however if you need to step off for any reason such as a bathroom break or letting another hiker pass you can find deep unpacked snow.
- Sinking down into the trail damages the trail for others, commonly known as "postholing". If you sink down due to not having snowshoes, you've created a hole in the trail that others now have to avoid and can easily cause someone to trip or twist their ankle.

There are two main types of snowshoes:
### Flat Terrain Snowshoes
These snowshoes are the stereotypical snowshoes; long, wide, with plenty of surface area to stop you from sinking if you were walking in an open patch of deep snow.

**When would you want flat terrain snowshoes?**

If trekking on flat wide trails, such as snowmobile trails, flat terrain snowshoes can be cheaper and easier to acquire than mountaineering snowshoes.

The large size and lack of traction on most models of this type of shoe means they aren't ideal for any kind of hike with elevation or where climbing up rocks or around trees may be required.

### Mountaineering Snowshoes
While there are some snowshoes that fit in a middle ground, the other primary type of snowshoes are mountaineering shoes.

These snowshoes are shorter and narrower than traditional snowshoes and have metal crampons built into them for gripping snow and ice on uneven terrain.

**When would you want mountaineering snowshoes?**

Any time where you are ascending or descending on trails and expect deep snow. Opinions vary, but generally when the snow is 8 in (20 cm) deep is when snowshoes start becoming helpful. Keep in mind snow at higher elevations is typically much deeper than at the base of a climb.

### Maximum Weights
Snowshoes will typically have a maximum weight they are rated for. You should keep this weight in mind when choosing a shoe as exceeding the maximum weight of the shoe can lead to sinking despite having snowshoes. Mountaineering shoes are a careful balance between being just big enough to support you on snow without becoming unwieldly. Many negative experiences with snowshoes are caused by improper use.

## Crampons

While crampons for ice climbing or glacier travel are out of the scope of this article, there are certain hiking trails and backpacking routes where 10 point crampons may be warranted.

**What are crampons?**

True crampons are large spikes that you strap onto the bottom of your boots, and are much more rigid than microspikes. Their design means they should only be worn with rigid boots as trail runners will flex and could damage the crampons.

**When do you want crampons?**

Crampons are useful when you will be ascending a steep trail with large sections of hard, thick, and fairly steep ice. This kind of terrain is typically too much for the small spikes on microspikes to stop you from sliding and warrants the larger spikes and superior grip granted by crampons.

Lower elevation hiking trails requiring crampons are fairly uncommon, so research to determine if the trails near you or that you'd be planning on hiking would require them.

**Other varieties of crampons:**

Larger crampons for ice climbing and glacier travel, such as 12 point or 14 point crampons, exist. However these are outside the scope of what should be required for any typical winter day hike or backpack route. 

## Additional Notes

### Gaiters
As a baseline, gaiters can help to ensure that snow doesn't end up inside your boots. However as your traction requirements increase gaiters also serve to protect your legs from that traction. Gaiters can help ensure that you don't accidentally stab your ankles or cut up your pants with spikes or crampons.

### Trekking Poles
Trekking poles will be discussed in their own article but it's worth noting that they can help greatly when traversing slippery terrain. When using them in snow make sure you've attached snow baskets to the bottom of the poles.
